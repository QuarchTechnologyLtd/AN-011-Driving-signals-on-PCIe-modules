but could be adapted for any module which supports driving, by selecting
a signal name that is present on your specific module

Uses a 100mS glitch from the glitch engine to combine with the driving feature to drive the PERST signal low for 100mS
We then use the glitch 'cycle' function to repeat the glitches in a set pattern.  This is designed to stress the drive by resetting
it multiple times
